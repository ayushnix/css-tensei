# css-tensei (転生, reincarnation)

css-tensei is a collection of CSS files that are meant to be used on static sites with a strong
focus on text, readability, accessibility, and reducing distractions.

## Web Browser Compatibility

There is no intent or desire to maintain compatibility with any version of Internet Explorer. This
project is intended to be used for the following browser engines and web browsers:

- Gecko: Firefox Stable and ESR
- Blink: Chromium Stable, qt5-webengine browsers like qutebrowser
- WebKit: Safari Desktop, Safari iOS, webkit2gtk browsers like luakit and Epiphany

## TODO

- switch to [CSS logical properties][1] whenever they get their own [shorthand logical syntax][2]
  and browser wide support for them becomes available
